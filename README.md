# 🌍 Blockchain-Based Blue Carbon Registry and MRV System  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project provides a **transparent, decentralized, and verifiable Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system** for **blue carbon ecosystem restoration** (mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes).  

It combines **Blockchain, AI/ML, and Decentralized Storage** to ensure:  
- Tamper-proof plantation and restoration records  
- Automated carbon credit issuance  
- Incentivization of communities and NGOs  

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement  
- Lack of decentralized and verifiable MRV system for blue carbon projects  
- Existing systems are prone to **data manipulation and low transparency**  
- No trusted mechanism for **carbon credit generation**  
- Communities often lack **incentives for participation**  

---

## 💡 Solution  
The project introduces a **Blockchain-powered Blue Carbon Registry** with:  
- 📌 Immutable storage of verified plantation and restoration data  
- 📌 **Smart contracts** for tokenized carbon credits  
- 📌 **AI/ML validation** through:  
  - NDVI-based vegetation health monitoring  
  - Automated tree survival counting (drone inputs)  
  - Fraud and anomaly detection in field submissions  
- 📌 Decentralized storage via **IPFS/Filecoin** for evidence (images, videos, reports)  
- 📌 Incentive mechanisms including **tokens and gamification rewards** for communities

## ⚙️ Features  
- ✅ Role-based dashboards (Community, NGO, Admin)  
- ✅ AI-driven validation of field and satellite data  
- ✅ Decentralized evidence storage using IPFS/Filecoin  
- ✅ Blockchain-backed carbon credit registry  
- ✅ Tokenized incentives and gamification features  
- ✅ Admin tools for validation, approval, and compliance reporting

## 🏗️ System Architecture  
**Frontend:** React.js + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn-ui  
**Mobile App (Field Users):** React Native / Flutter  
**Backend:** Node.js + Express.js  
**Blockchain:** Solidity (Ethereum/Polygon) smart contracts  
**AI/ML:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV (NDVI analysis, survival detection, anomaly detection)  
**Storage:** IPFS / Filecoin  

---

## 🔄 Workflow (End-to-End)  
1️⃣ Stakeholder onboarding (NGOs, communities, administrators)  
2️⃣ Plantation and restoration data collected via mobile app, drones, and satellites  
3️⃣ Field users upload geo-tagged images, survival counts, and reports  
4️⃣ AI/ML validates data (NDVI health, survival analysis, fraud detection)  
5️⃣ Evidence stored on **IPFS/Filecoin**, metadata on blockchain  
6️⃣ Smart contracts issue **tokenized carbon credits**  
7️⃣ Admin dashboard used for review, approval, and compliance reporting  
8️⃣ Communities rewarded through tokens and gamification  
9️⃣ Transparent MRV system strengthens accountability and trust
