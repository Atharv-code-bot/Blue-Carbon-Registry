# 🌍 Blockchain-Based Blue Carbon Registry and MRV System  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is developed for **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025**. It aims to build a **transparent, decentralized, and verifiable Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system** for **blue carbon ecosystem restoration** (mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes).  

The system leverages **Blockchain, AI/ML, and Decentralized Storage** to ensure **tamper-proof data, automated carbon credit issuance, and community incentives.**  

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement  
- No decentralized and verifiable MRV system for blue carbon projects.  
- Current processes lack **transparency, trust, and automation**.  
- No direct mechanism for **carbon credit generation**.  
- Communities and NGOs lack **incentives and recognition**.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution  
We propose a **Blockchain-powered Blue Carbon Registry** where:  
- 📌 Verified plantation & restoration data is **immutably stored**.  
- 📌 **Smart contracts** issue **tokenized carbon credits**.  
- 📌 **AI/ML models** validate data via:  
  - NDVI vegetation health monitoring.  
  - Automated tree survival counting (drone input).  
  - Fraud/anomaly detection in field submissions.  
- 📌 Evidence is stored on **IPFS/Filecoin**, with blockchain storing metadata.  
- 📌 Communities are rewarded with **tokens & gamification incentives**.

## ⚙️ Features  
- ✅ Role-based dashboards (Community, NGO, Admin).  
- ✅ AI-driven validation (NDVI maps, fraud detection, tree survival counts).  
- ✅ Decentralized file storage with **IPFS/Filecoin**.  
- ✅ Blockchain-based carbon credit registry.  
- ✅ Gamification & community incentives.  
- ✅ Admin dashboard for NCCR to monitor, approve, and generate reports.

## 🏗️ System Architecture  
**Frontend:** React.js + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn-ui  
**Mobile App (Field Users):** React Native / Flutter  
**Backend:** Node.js + Express.js  
**Blockchain:** Solidity (Ethereum/Polygon) for smart contracts  
**AI/ML:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV (NDVI + survival analysis + anomaly detection)  
**Storage:** IPFS / Filecoin  

---

## 🔄 Workflow (End-to-End)  
1️⃣ Stakeholder onboarding (NGOs, communities, NCCR).  
2️⃣ Plantation & restoration data collected via mobile app + drone + satellite.  
3️⃣ Field users upload geo-tagged images, survival counts, reports.  
4️⃣ AI/ML validates data (NDVI health, fraud detection, tree survival).  
5️⃣ Evidence stored on **IPFS/Filecoin**, blockchain stores hashes.  
6️⃣ Smart contracts issue tokenized carbon credits.  
7️⃣ Admin reviews, approves, and generates compliance reports.  
8️⃣ Communities receive tokens, rewards, and recognition.  
9️⃣ Transparent MRV system strengthens India’s blue carbon strategy.
